Present the UML diagrams of the reception robot, UML is a language to model software solutions, application structures, system behavior and business processes. we use 3 types of UML diagrams to describe the reception robot project, which are use case diagram, state machine diagram, and sequence diagram.

Tese three diagrams are behavioral Diagrams that help us to understand the actors involved in a system, describe the behavior of objects according to states, and show how objects interact with each other in order in which those interactions occur.
